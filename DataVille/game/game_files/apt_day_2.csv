Hi. I’m Tim. I’m an image labeler. Have you had any strange experiences with DataVille? A group of us have been gathering information and found:
-Harsh write-ups over trivial or inconsistent criticism.
-Labelers not receiving their paychecks (or not getting the full amount).
-Sudden and unexplained firings.

We intend to take these findings to management and file an official complaint. Can we count on your support?

In solidarity,
-Tim (section 18, cohort 48)
