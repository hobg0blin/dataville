Thanks for all your hard work. Take a moment to review your metrics. There are some parts that could be improved. Unfortunately, your performance is not eligible for an incentive bonus at this time. Let’s try to raise those scores on the next set. It will be more challenging, so keep at it. People are depending on you.

If these low numbers continue, we’ll need to make a performance improvement plan. Please take your time and do your best. People are depending on you.

“Welcome to the team. I hope you’re getting settled into your new job. I wanted to let you know that the Dataville Annotators have been in the process of forming a labor union. We feel we could get better treatment if we grouped together. There have been problems with workers not receiving their full pay out and many people have been fired with no notice. Would you be interested in potentially joining us?

Thanks
-Tim”
