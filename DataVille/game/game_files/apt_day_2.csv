Subject: Performance Review

Thanks for all your hard work. Take a moment to review your metrics. There are some parts that could be improved. Unfortunately, your performance is not eligible for an incentive bonus at this time. Let’s try to raise those scores on the next set. It will be more challenging, so keep at it. Humanity is depending on you.

Happy labeling!

Subject: Performance Review

I’ve been reviewing your output and I’m disappointed to say your performance metrics are ranking poorly. Let me know if there’s anything I can do to get those numbers up. If these low numbers continue, we’ll need to make a performance improvement plan. Please take your time and do your best. Humanity is depending on you. 

Happy labeling!

Subject: Improving Working Conditions

Hi. I’m Tim. I’m an image labeler. Have you had any strange experiences with DataVille? A group of us have been gathering information and found:
-Harsh write-ups over trivial or inconsistent criticism.
-Labelers not receiving their paychecks (or not getting the full amount).
-Sudden and unexplained firings.
-Labelers not receiving their final paycheck (sometimes upwards of 2k unpaid!).


Our group intends to take these findings to management and file an official complaint. Can we count on your support?

In solidarity,
-Tim (section 18, cohort 48)
