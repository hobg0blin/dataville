Your targets are enmeshed deeply in the fabric of society: at restaurants, convenience stores, factories and farms. Some cry when the cuffs come out. Others offer stoic responses or nothing at all. You prefer when they go quietly.\n\nOne day, you’re raiding an apartment building and find dozens of alien adolescents. It appears to be some kind of safehouse for orphaned youth. As you load them up in the van, you can’t help but wonder how the system will deal with them. You hope the social workers will be able to help their situation. You hope their lives will be better at the Resettlement Camp. Maybe they will be placed with human foster families. \n\nYou don’t really know what happens after you deliver them to the processing facility.

He informs you that your work performance analytics are too low and that he’s obligated to release you from your current role as an annotator/labeler.

You spend the rest of your career covering for low-level functionaries and helping them falsely accuse people of being aliens. \n\nAs uncertainty and fear spread throughout society, you take solace in your modest apartment and the comfort it provides. Life is messy and scary, but you manage to navigate an avenue of self-preservation. And that’s good enough for you.

Your life continues uneventfully.\n\nOne day you’re called into a Zoom meeting with your supervisor, Alex. Some of your responses have raised concerns about accuracy, more specifically, false positives. You are forced to endure hours of remedial corporate training  about unconscious bias, racial prejudice, and, just to be safe, sexual harassment. The sessions are long, unpaid, and extremely boring. \n\nYou regret ever falsely identifying your landlady as an alien and resolve to be more accurate.

It’s not what you dreamed of doing, but it’s a gig. \n\nOne morning, a team of federal security contractors is in the lobby looking for your landlady. You have no choice but to show them to her door. They accuse her of presenting red flags in their advanced, AI-powered alien detection software. She is bewildered as they drag her out in cuffs to await further more invasive testing. \n\nYou can’t help but think this is your fault. Let’s hope your next paycheck deposits normally.

You poke your head into the hallway in time to watch a team of federal security contractors removing your elderly landlady in cuffs. They ignore her as she protests, proclaiming her innocence. A heavy-handed officer silences her with his baton. \n\nYou drink your coffee and consider what to do next. Looks like you don’t have to pay rent any time soon.

Although you don’t feel rich, you are no longer preoccupied with how you are going to pay rent. \n\nOne day, the DataVille Corporate office approaches you with a proposition. As part of DataVille’s ongoing public sector partnerships, you’ve been invited to join a representative’s office in Congress as an AI detection specialist. You leap at the opportunity to start a new, more substantive chapter of your career. \n\nYou are disappointed to discover the job is just administering detection tests to staffers and interns.
