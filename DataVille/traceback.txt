I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

While running game code:
  File "game/script.rpy", line 48, in script
    init python:
  File "game/script.rpy", line 268, in <module>
    day_start()
  File "game/script.rpy", line 261, in day_start
    make_task_loop('game_files/tasks_day_' + day + '.csv', store.loop)
  File "game/script.rpy", line 148, in make_task_loop
    with open(renpy.loader.transfn(filename), 'r') as current_loop:
Exception: Couldn't find file 'game_files/tasks_day_0.csv'.
