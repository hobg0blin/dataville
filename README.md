**INSTRUCTIONS FOR LINUX**

To set up with Ren'Py, [download Renpy](https://www.renpy.org/latest.html) - for best results, use Ren'Py 8.1.3 (this has not been tested on more recent builds). Then, in the terminal:

Clone this repo into the same directory you saved RenPy to: `git clone https://github.com/hobg0blin/dataville.git`

Move into the Ren'Py launch directory: `cd renpy-8.1.3-sdk/`

Start Ren'Py: `bash renpy.sh`

For other OSes, you should be able to download and directly launch the sdk - instructions [here](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/quickstart.html)
